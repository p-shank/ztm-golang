//--Summary:
//  The existing program is used to restrict access to a resource
//  based on day of the week and user role. Currently, the program
//  allows any user to access the resource. Implement the functionality
//  needed to grant resource access using any combination of `if`, `else if`,
//  and `else`.
//
//--Requirements:
//* Use the accessGranted() and accessDenied() functions to display
//  informational messages
//* Access at any time: Admin, Manager
//* Access weekends: Contractor
//* Access weekdays: Member
//* Access Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays: Guest
